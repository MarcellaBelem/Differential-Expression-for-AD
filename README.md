abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in memory loss, language difficulties, problems with reasoning and other cognitive abilities. AD is the most common form of dementia among older adults and is associated with the deposition of beta-amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. AD has a strong genetic factor, around 70\% is related to heritability and identifying the associated genes and how they influence AD ​​is important. To achieve this goal, public RNA-seq data from three experiments cataloged in the Gene Expression Omnibus database will be used. A bioinformatic pipeline will be developed, consisting of quality analysis, trimming, gene expression quantification and differential expression. At the end of this work, it is expected to identify potential genetic biomarkers that influence to risk to develop the disease.
